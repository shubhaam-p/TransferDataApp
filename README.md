# Transfer data App 
I created this to transfer data from my phone to my laptop using the HTTP File server app [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=slowscript.httpfileserver&pcampaignid=web_share). 

### Description
First, we fetch the data from this File server, then we store the names of these files in a Txt file.
Afterward looping through these file names, download them using promises for better performance.
